//Many modifiers can be applied to containers, which allows us to apply the same modifier to many views at the same time.
//From a coding perspective these modifiers are used exactly the same way as regular modifiers. However, they behave subtly differently because if any of those child views override the same modifier, the childâ€™s version takes priority.
